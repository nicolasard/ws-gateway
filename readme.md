    # WS-Gateway

    This is an dummy app to intercept WS calls and forward them to some WS.

    #### Motivation

    My mom is accountant, she use a closed propietary application for accounting that consist in a WS server and desktop clients
    that connects to the server.

    To improve the monitoring of the service and do some reverse-engineering I created this app.

    #NOTE: THIS APP IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
